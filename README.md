# This is now useless.
jam1garner's smash-minecraft-skins removes the need to flatten any Minecraft Skin if you have the mod installed.
In fact, you don't even need to make a mod yourself! His mod does it all, and is very user-friendly.

# About
Uses the Mojang API to download a skin based off of their username, and then flattens the skin.
It will remove the transparency and replace it with #6a6a6a, to improve compression.
It also adjusts the colors, so that the skins don't blast you with pure light in-game.
I will not be updating this to convert 64x32 skins, many other tools exist. Pretty much, what you see is what you get with this script. I know this is some next-level spaghetti code, so feel free to make a more optimized version of this program. I am aware Alex skins can be finicky sometimes, so be aware that unexpected things may happen.

# Dependencies
You need Pillow to run this.
