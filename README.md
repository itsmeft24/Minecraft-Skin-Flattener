# This is now useless.
jam1garner's smash-minecraft-skins removes the need to flatten any Minecraft Skin if you have the mod installed.
In fact, you don't even need to make a mod yourself! His mod does it all, and is very user-friendly.

# About
Uses Minotaur to download a skin based off of their username, and then flattens the skin.
It will remove the transparency and replace it with #6a6a6a, just like how Smash expects.
It also lowers the brightness, so that the skins don't blast you with pure light in-game.
I will not be updating this to convert 64x32 skins, many other tools exist. Pretty much, what you see is what you get with this script. I know this is some next-level spaghetti code, so feel free to make a more optimized version of this program.

# Dependencies
You need wget and Pillow to run this.
