# Minecraft-Skin-Flattener
Flattens 64x64 Minecraft Skins for use in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

# Features
Uses Minotaur to download a skin based off of their username, and then flattens the skin.
It will remove the transparency and replace it with #6a6a6a, just like how Smash expects.
It also lowers the brightness, so that the skins don't blast you with pure light in-game.

# This is it.
I will not be updating this to convert 64x32 skins, many other tools exist. Pretty much, what you see is what you get with this script. I know this is some next-level spaghetti code, so feel free to make a more optimized version of this program.

# Dependencies
You need wget and Pillow to run this.
